                <p>Here is a showcase of my best games. The games were created in a wide variety of programs, including Unity and Unreal Engine.
                    I will add my role in the development of the game. If the game is available to download/play, I will provide a link.

                    <h1>Advoidment</h1>
                    <p>This is a game that I created in Unity 2D in a team of 5 for our Casual Game Development class.
                        The game has you completing bite sized minigames so you can get rid of them to press a bagel as many times as you can.
                        I served as the main minigame programmer.

                    <p>This is a game created in the Unreal Engine in a team of 7 for our IGME Production Studio class.
                        The game is a short 3D collectathon where you must run around a level and catch all the Mungos that got loose.
                        I worked as the Tech Art Lead, creating all the models and animations.
                        <br><br>A downloadable version of the game will be available soon! You can check my work in the 'Models' section.

                        We were tasked to create a puzzle game set in the world of Ethshar, and this is our product after five weeks.
                        I served as the Version Control Lead, a 3D Designer, and a Programmer.

                        This was a game I made in my Interactive Media Development class. 
                        The project began by following specific instructions, but for the end, we got free control with what we can do.
                        I went above and beyond with what I included, such as menus and music.

                        This was the final for my Intro to Game Web Tech class, where we had to create any kind of game.  
                        It is a high score based game where you dodge enemies and see how long you can last.

                    <p>This is a game created using Monogame and C#.  It was the final project for my Game Dev & Algo Prob Solve II class (technically my first game!).
                        In a team of five people, we made a game where you avoid the guards to reach the end. I worked on the sprites, as well as an early prototype.
