                <p>Here is a showcase of many games that I have created. The games were created in a wide variety of programs, including Unity and Unreal Engine.
                    I will add my role in the development of the game. If the game is available to download/play, I will provide a link.

                    <h1>Apple of my Eye</h1>
                    <p>In late October 2025, I participated in the Cozy Fall Jam 2025, which lasted four days. The theme was "lost and found", as well as a general fall theme. 
                        The game is a simple sidescroller where you must catch apples that fall from the trees, and deliver them to the drop off areas.  
                        I was the sole developer of this game, working on game/level design, programming, and art. The game was made in Unity.

                        The game is a 2D platformer with a CRT effect where you can buy checkpoints that get increasingly more expensive. 
                        I was the sole developer of this game, working on game/level design, programming, and art. The game was made in Unity.

                    <p>In early October 2025, I participated in the Jamsepticeye Game Jam, which lasted five days. The theme was "Death is an Opportunity". 
                        This game is a simple 2D platformer where you can die to become a ghost and float through objects. 
                        I was the sole developer of this game, working on game/level design, programming, and art. The game was made in Unity.

                    <p>In August 2025, I participated in the Doki Jam, where participants had two weeks to create a game based on the theme, "chain reactions". 
                        As the player, you must select the appropriate reaction to give while watching a video to earn points.
                        I worked on this game on my own, which means I did the game design, programming, and art. The game was made in Unity.

                        The game was created with Godot, and I was the Art Lead, as well as Game Designer.

                        The game has you completing bite sized minigames so you can get rid of them to press a bagel as many times as you can.
                        I served as the main minigame programmer.

                        The game is a short 3D collectathon where you must run around a level and catch all the Mungos that got loose.
                        I worked as the Tech Art Lead, creating all the models and animations.

                        We were tasked to create a puzzle game set in the world of Ethshar, and this is our product after five weeks.
                        I served as the Version Control Lead, a 3D Designer, and a Programmer.

                        The project began by following specific instructions, but for the end, we got free control with what we can do.
                        I went above and beyond with what I included, such as menus and music.

                        This was the final for my Intro to Game Web Tech class (November - December 2021), where we had to create any kind of game.  
                        It is a high score based game where you dodge enemies and see how long you can last.

                        In a team of five people, we made a game where you avoid the guards to reach the end. I worked on the sprites, as well as an early prototype.
