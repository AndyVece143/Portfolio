                <p>Here is a showcase of my best models. I first learned how to make 3D models using Maya, and then I switched to Blender later on. 
                    Every model showcased here was created and textured by me.
                    The textures were made using Adobe Substance Painter and Blender.  Screenshots were taken in either their respective program or the project where they were used.
                    Some models were created for projects, while others were created for fun. For each image, I will include a description as well as anything interesting that happened during the creation. 
                    Try hovering over the pictures, you may see an alternate picture.

                        This was my first time as a technical artist, and I was teaching myself how to animate as I went along.
