            <div class="introduction">
                <p>Here is a showcase of my best models. I first learned how to make 3D models using Maya, and then I switched to Blender later on. 
                    Every model showcased here was created and textured by me.
                    The textures were made using Adobe Substance Painter and Blender.  Screenshots were taken in either their respective program or the project where they were used.
                    Some models were created for projects, while others were created for fun. For each image, I will include a description as well as anything interesting that happened during the creation.

                    <p>This is a collage of various models for the game "Funky Mungos", a semester long project (Fall 2023) where we created a video game.
                        I was the Technical Artist, creating all the models and animations.

                    <p>This is a simple render I made for the game "Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance". 
                        It features Black Frost proudly holding an advertisement for the game. 
                        I used this render to test out shadows and spotlights in Blender.

                    <p>This is the Keyblade "Kingdom Key" from the Kingdom Hearts series. 
                        I used this render to test out reflective materials and chain physics. 
                        Fun fact, the Kingdom Key is the first object I modeled on my own.</p>

                        The characters are in the same poses from their official artwork. 
                        This is one of the first renders I made in Blender.

                        For this render, I learned how to add glow effects with Emission. 
                        I also learned about using 3D text in Blender.
