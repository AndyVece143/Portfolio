                    <h2>iD Tech Camps</h2>
                    <p>I worked at iD Tech Camps in the summer of 2024 in Middletown, Connecticut. 
                        I instructed three different levels of Roblox Game Development for children ages 7-13. 
                        I taught my students important game design principles, how to create and publish games, and a basic introduction to coding in Lua. 
                        I was also in charge of the kids outside of class, supervising them during lunch and activity breaks, as well as morning dropoff and afternoon pickup.

                    <h2>Changeling VR</h2>
                    <p>I worked on Changeling VR, an ongoing RIT project, during the spring semester of 2024 (January - May). 
                        I worked as a technical artist, creating 3D models, textures, and animations for the game. 
                        The assets that I created were made in Blender, and then exported into the Unreal project. 
                        I also had to work with Perforce to ensure that everyone has access to my new files.

                    <h2>Curved Glass Distrubutors</h2>
                    <p>For every summer from 2017 to 2023, I worked at Curved Class Distributors as a warehouse worker. 
                        My main job was to store windshields and tempered glass, and report the locations to the person in charge of inventory. 
                        Quite frequently, I had to assist with transporting large amounts of glass and materials in cooperation with two or more co-workers. 
                        I also performed janitorial duties such as sweeping and trash removal.
